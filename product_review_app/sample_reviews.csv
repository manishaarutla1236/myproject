Worst product ever. It stopped working after a week.
Decent quality for the price. Not too bad.
I'm really happy with my purchase. Fast delivery too!
Terrible experience. Customer service was rude.
"The product is okay, but packaging was poor."
Fantastic! It exceeded my expectations.
Not worth the money. Totally disappointed.
